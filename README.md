In this dataset, we try to predict the air quality with time series. The dataset was taken from UCI Machine Learning and has multivariate time series. We use only one target feature CO, to make further predictions.

# Abalone- A better result with NN  -  Danil Kirilenko.
From the previous task, due to a multivariate classes, our prediction had not a satisfying accuracy. This time, we use the NN method  and increase the accuracy of our model
